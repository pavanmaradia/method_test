Method Test 


What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.
> Through out my carrier, I witness great amount of Proud moments, however there are few which could be worth mention here. 
While I was leaning to become a FullStack developer, I started side project (to learn HTML5, SASS, JQuery) "Online review system" , where reviewer can review shots online from anywhere and create note (either text or drawing) on any frame and those review screens has been store inside respective shot for artist. Feel proud of that because though its a side project on which I was working in my leisure time but it was most loved one in Trace VFX Studio.
The other Proud moment is while one non performer resourced aline to me and he becomes the performer of the month from team.
